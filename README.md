# Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur (Release 74)

## What is this?

This repository contains source code and other files which were, as far as anyone can tell, involved in the original production of release 74 of the Infocom game Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur.

## Where did it come from?

This repository was forked from [zil-legacy/arthur-r74-eblong](https://github.com/zil-legacy/arthur-r74-eblong).

## What is it for?

Apart from the obvious historical and educational interest, I think it would be really good to know if a game file can be built from the source code in this repository using Jesse McGrew's ZILF toolset.
